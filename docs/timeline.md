Day 1:
1. Review synth solution, understand the basics of how to make a sound and decide whether or not to implement with React
  - (If I can't figure out a regular JS solution by the middle of the morning I will use React)
2. Pick the sounds I want and implement the playing of them with the keyboard
3. Build out main keyboard GUI

Day 2:
1. Build out front end further with essential functional buttons (play, shuffle, chord select)
2. Work on possible extra buttons (toggle cheat bar, play 1 key at a time, show chord name)

Day 3:
1. Seed data (chords, possible pictures)
2. Bugfix the inevitable deluge of bugs that have accumulated
3. Styling
